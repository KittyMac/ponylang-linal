# Style Guide

ponylang-linal follows the [Pony standard library Style Guide](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.md) with some caveats.

linal uses many tuple objects and these sometimes
span multiple lines and are sometimes aligned vertically rather than the suggestion for continuation lines in the style guide. In addition, often the math is quite verbose and is easier to read when aligned. In some places, spaces were added to vertically align columns for math operations.
